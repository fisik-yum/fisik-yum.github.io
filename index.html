    <div class="tier1">Hi!</div>

      <p>
        Hey! I'm fisik! I'm passionate about books, code, open source, geography, and the linux ecosystem in general! I
        love thinking of ways to make things work better, or just make life better!
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that simplicity is key, and this personal website is the emodiment of what I think simplicity looks
        like, when it comes to design. I really do enjoy the "retro" look.
      </p>
      <p>Anyway, if you want to take a look at the various things that I'm working on, head to PROJECTS. If you want to
        read some opinions pieces, head on to BLOG. Lastly, click on CONTACTS if you really want to talk to me for some
        reason.</p>
